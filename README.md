I have filtered the green colour using appropriate BGR values. Then by using morphological transformation noise is removed. Lastly, these colour values are tracked and mapped accordingly to the mouse pointer using basic mathematics - also gives access to click and drag function(geometry concepts) like in the mouse.

#The core libraries used :

1) cv2
2) numpy
3) pynput
4) tkinter

I have made a virtual environment in Pycharm and instaled the following above packages.
